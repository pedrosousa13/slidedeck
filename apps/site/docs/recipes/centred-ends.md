# Centre the first and last slide

With `scroll-snap-align: center`, the first slide cannot reach the centre of
the viewport, which cannot scroll before the slide's start: the deck rests
with the first slide at the start edge, and the slide nearest the centre is
focal. The last slide is the same at the end. Without `loop`, pad the viewport
at each end by half its width less half a slide, so the scroll range runs far
enough:

<!-- example: apps/storybook/stories/recipes/centred-ends.css -->

```css
/* Slides 280px wide, 16px apart, each centred, the first and last too. */
.products {
  --slide-width: 280px;
}
.products [data-slidedeck-viewport] {
  gap: 16px;
  /* Half the viewport less half a slide, at each end. */
  padding-inline: calc(50% - var(--slide-width) / 2);
}
.products [data-slidedeck-slide] {
  width: var(--slide-width);
  scroll-snap-align: center;
}
```

Give the slides a width that is not a percentage, such as `px`, `rem` or `vw`:
the padding's percentage is of the deck's width, and a slide's is of the
viewport's content box, which the padding narrows. With `loop`, the copies
either side already let the first and last slides reach the centre.

The story is `Recipes / Centred Ends`. An end-to-end test checks that the deck
rests with the first slide centred, and the last after a move to it.
