# Play a playdeck video in the focal slide

A social-style deck of videos: the video in the focal slide plays, muted, and
the others pause. Each slide holds a [playdeck](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@playdeck/react)
player; `onFocalChange` tells the deck's parent which slide is focal once a
scroll settles, and each player's handle plays or pauses it. It works with
`loop`, as a feed usually is.

```sh
pnpm add @playdeck/react
```

<!-- example: apps/storybook/stories/video-deck.tsx -->

```tsx
import {
  useEffect,
  useEffectEvent,
  useImperativeHandle,
  useRef,
  type Ref
} from 'react';
import * as Deck from '@slidedeck/react';
import * as Player from '@playdeck/react';

const REDUCED_MOTION = '(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)';

/** A deck of videos: the one in the focal slide plays, muted; the rest pause.
 * Under reduced motion none plays by itself; a viewer can still press play. */
export function VideoDeck({
  sources,
  loop = false,
  ref
}: {
  sources: readonly string[];
  loop?: boolean;
  /** Each slide's player handle, by slide index, null while unmounted. */
  ref?: Ref<readonly (Player.PlayerHandle | null)[]>;
}) {
  const players = useRef<(Player.PlayerHandle | null)[]>([]);
  const focal = useRef(0);
  useImperativeHandle(ref, () => players.current, []);

  const playFocal = (slide: number) => {
    focal.current = slide;
    const still = () => matchMedia(REDUCED_MOTION).matches;
    players.current.forEach((player, i) => {
      if (i !== slide || still()) void player?.pause();
    });
    if (still()) return;
    // A player loads as its slide comes into view: wait until it can play,
    // and play only if its slide is still the focal one.
    const player = players.current[slide];
    void player?.whenReady().then((ready) => {
      if (ready && focal.current === slide && !still()) void player.play();
    });
  };

  // onFocalChange does not fire for where the deck starts, nor when the
  // viewer's motion preference changes: play or pause for both.
  const replay = useEffectEvent(() => playFocal(focal.current));
  useEffect(() => {
    const query = matchMedia(REDUCED_MOTION);
    const onChange = () => replay();
    onChange();
    query.addEventListener('change', onChange);
    return () => query.removeEventListener('change', onChange);
  }, []);

  return (
    <Deck.Root
      aria-label="Featured slides"
      onFocalChange={playFocal}
      loop={loop}
    >
      <Deck.Viewport>
        {sources.map((source, i) => (
          <Deck.Slide key={i}>
            <SlideVideo
              source={source}
              register={(slide, player) => {
                players.current[slide] = player;
              }}
            />
          </Deck.Slide>
        ))}
      </Deck.Viewport>
      <Deck.Prev />
      <Deck.Next />
    </Deck.Root>
  );
}

/** A slide's player, registered by the slide's index. A loop's copy renders
 * the slide again: it shows the video's first frame, still, and registers
 * nothing, so it never replaces or clears the slide's player. */
function SlideVideo({
  source,
  register
}: {
  source: string;
  register: (slide: number, player: Player.PlayerHandle | null) => void;
}) {
  const { index, copy } = Deck.useSlide();
  if (copy) {
    return (
      <video
        // A start time, as a media fragment, makes Safari load and paint the
        // first frame too, where metadata alone shows nothing.
        src={`${source}#t=0.001`}
        muted
        playsInline
        preload="metadata"
        style={{
          display: 'block',
          width: '100%',
          aspectRatio: '16 / 9',
          objectFit: 'contain'
        }}
      />
    );
  }
  return (
    <Player.Root
      ref={(player) => register(index, player)}
      source={source}
      defaultMuted
      loop
    >
      <Player.Viewport style={{ aspectRatio: '16 / 9' }}>
        <Player.Media />
        <Player.Controls>
          <Player.PlayButton />
        </Player.Controls>
      </Player.Viewport>
    </Player.Root>
  );
}
```

Show part of the next slide so the deck reads as a feed:

```css
[data-slidedeck-viewport] {
  gap: 16px;
}
[data-slidedeck-slide] {
  width: 80%;
}
```

Notes:

- The videos are muted so the browser lets them play without a gesture. Each
  keeps playdeck's own play button, so a viewer can pause the one playing.
- Under reduced motion no video plays by itself, and turning the preference
  on pauses the one playing; a viewer can still press play. Playdeck applies
  reduced motion only to its own `autoplay`, not to `play()` called from code,
  so the recipe checks `prefers-reduced-motion` itself.
- A playdeck player loads when it comes into view. `whenReady` waits for that,
  and the focal check stops a late load from playing a slide the deck has
  left.
- With `loop`, the deck renders each slide again in its copies. Each
  slide's content calls `Deck.useSlide()`: a slide registers its player by
  its index, and a copy shows the video's first frame, still, and registers
  nothing. No copy's player can replace or clear a slide's, and the focal
  slide's video plays once the deck crosses the seam and jumps.
- `VideoDeck`'s `ref` gives its parent the player handles, by slide index.

The stories `Deck / Playdeck Video` and `Deck / Playdeck Video Loop` in this
repo's storybook run this component, and end-to-end tests check that only the
focal slide's video plays, across a loop's seam both ways too, and that none
plays under reduced motion.
