# @slidedeck/react

## 1.0.2

### Patch Changes

- d1b54e7: Server HTML now carries each slide's starting `--deck-slide-progress`: its distance in slides from the slide the deck starts at, a loop's copy by its own place. Effects and your own CSS on progress paint from the server HTML, before any script runs, so a server-rendered `curve` deck no longer paints flat and then jumps into its arc at hydration, and slides scaled by progress no longer render full size and then shrink. With equal-size slides, one per snap point, nothing changes at hydration; with slides of different sizes the engine corrects the estimate when it measures.

## 1.0.1

### Patch Changes

- 166c6b8: The documentation moved to https://slidedeck.pages.dev/docs/, where each guide, reference page and recipe shows its feature in a live deck. The package README keeps the install steps, the quickstart and the comparison with Embla and Keen, and links to the site. Both packages' `homepage` is now the site. No code changed.

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- 0a4297e: 1.0.0 is the first stable release. Nothing breaks from 0.3.3: update and your deck works as before. From now on the public API follows semver: every export of both packages, the components' props, the `data-slidedeck-*` attributes and the `--deck-*` CSS custom properties change in a breaking way only in a major version.

## 0.3.3

### Patch Changes

- e7e406f: A pen swipe no longer reports a slide as it starts. When the browser takes a pen over to pan the deck, a deck that came to rest under the pen now waits for the pen to lift before it settles and calls `onIndexChange`, as it does for a touch. Where the browser gives no sign that the pen lifted, the deck settles 1 second after the pan begins.
- d232bb2: A looping deck no longer runs out of copies under quick chained trackpad or wheel flicks. Each flick went on from the momentum of the one before, so the deck never came to rest to jump off a copy, and it could scroll on to the end of the range. Now a wheel event along the deck's axis, while the deck is on the copies, moves it back onto the slides, to the same place, as a touch or a drag already did. Nothing shows: the index does not change and nothing is reported or announced.

## 0.3.2

### Patch Changes

- 62689d4: A deck rendered straight from a React server component now has Dots and Counter filled in its server HTML, one page per slide, as a deck in a client component does. They no longer render empty until hydration. `@slidedeck/react` now has a `react-server` export condition, which frameworks such as the Next.js App Router resolve for a server component: its `Deck.Root` counts the slides there. The exports, props and types do not change. In a server file, `Deck.Root` is now a server component, so passing it as a value to a client component, as in `as={Deck.Root}`, fails: import it in the client component instead.
- @slidedeck/core@0.3.2

## 0.3.1

### Patch Changes

- a4f3339: `@slidedeck/react`, `@slidedeck/react/fade` and `@slidedeck/react/curve` now start with `'use client'`. In a React Server Components framework, such as the Next.js App Router, a server component can render the deck, with `effect={fade}` or `effect={curve}`, without a client component of your own. Function props such as `onIndexChange`, and a `ref` to the handle, still need a client component.
- @slidedeck/core@0.3.1

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 67a46f2: A deck no longer shows a scrollbar. It still scrolls by touch, trackpad, mouse wheel, drag, keyboard and its controls, and it snaps as before. Where scrollbars take layout space, as on Windows and most Linux desktops, the viewport no longer loses that space to one, so a horizontal deck is that much shorter and a vertical deck's slides that much wider.

  The default `scrollbar-width: none` is a zero-specificity rule, so any rule of yours wins. To bring the scrollbar back:

  ```css
  [data-slidedeck-viewport] {
    scrollbar-width: auto;
  }
  ```

  Safari before 18.2 does not support `scrollbar-width`. There the deck hides the scrollbar with `::-webkit-scrollbar { display: none }` instead, at the specificity of one element, so your `[data-slidedeck-viewport]::-webkit-scrollbar` rule wins. The native scrollbar cannot come back there: any `::-webkit-scrollbar` rule replaces it with one drawn from your CSS. To show a styled one there, and leave other browsers theirs (untested in Safari before 18.2):

  ```css
  @supports not (scrollbar-width: auto) {
    [data-slidedeck-viewport]::-webkit-scrollbar {
      display: block;
      width: 8px;
      height: 8px;
    }
    [data-slidedeck-viewport]::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb {
      background: rgb(0 0 0 / 0.4);
      border-radius: 4px;
    }
  }
  ```

### Patch Changes

- f53e539: A looping deck no longer runs out of copies when swipes or drags come faster than it comes to rest. Each swipe carried on from the momentum of the one before, so the deck never rested, never jumped back off the copies, and stopped at an end of its scroll range after a few swipes, on an iPhone and with a mouse in Chrome. Now a touch or pen pressed on the viewport while it is on the copies, or a mouse drag starting there, moves the deck back one set of slides, to the same place among them, before the swipe or drag goes on. Nothing shows: the index stays the same, `onIndexChange` does not fire, nothing is announced, focus stays where it is, and `--deck-slide-progress` and `data-in-view` read as before. A mouse click, and a tap during a move, change nothing.

  A touch that the browser turns into a pan now holds the deck until the finger lifts. Before, a deck that came to rest under the finger, at the end of a move or a fling, jumped off a copy and reported its index as the pan began.

  A looping deck with centred slides at an end of its scroll range, as after a hard drag or flick, stayed there on the copies, off its slides' snap points, and reported a slide it did not show. It now moves to the nearest snap point within the scroll range, and then jumps back onto its slide as usual.

- 9a9242a: In Chromium, after slides are removed or shrink so that the deck rests past the new end, the deck could stop following its layout: a controlled deck did not go back to `index` once slides were added again, Dots and Counter kept the old count, and a switch of `effect` or `loop` did not keep the current slide. It happened where Chromium never ended the scroll that moves the deck back into range, as after a touch fling on another scroller was cut short by leaving the page. The deck now treats that scroll as part of the new layout, and settles a scroll that is not the user's once no scroll event has come for 100ms. A scroll of the user's still settles only at its own end.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 6a3621e: Add `Deck.useDeck()`, a hook that gives any component inside `Deck.Root` the deck's state and moves, so you can build Prev, Next, a counter or pagination from your own components. It returns `index`, `count` (`null` until the viewport is measured, as on the server), `loop`, `fits`, `canPrev`, `canNext`, and `scrollTo(index)`, `next()` and `prev()`. The values are the ones `Deck.Prev`, `Deck.Next` and `Deck.Counter` read, so a custom control and a built-in one agree; a move stops autoplay, as a built-in control does. It never re-renders while the deck scrolls, only when `Deck.Root` does: when the deck settles somewhere new, its snap points change or, with `autoplay`, autoplay starts, stops or pauses. It throws outside `Deck.Root`. Its return type is exported as `UseDeckResult`.

### Patch Changes

- 4891b56: A deck follows a change of `dir` on an ancestor after it mounts, as a locale switch makes, without a remount. It stays on its slide, at rest, a move in flight still arrives on its target, and Next, the arrow keys, a mouse drag and `--deck-slide-progress` go the new way. In Firefox and WebKit the deck went back to its first slide.
- 09021e1: A controlled deck no longer undoes a move that starts just after it reports a new index, before React renders the parent taking that index: Next, Prev, a dot, `scrollTo`, a drag's release or an autoplay step. The deck went back to the reported index, and ended one slide short. Under load, as in WebKit on a busy machine, a press could come in that gap. Now an `index` the parent takes from `onIndexChange` never undoes a move started since, and the move goes on. A deck at rest elsewhere still goes to `index`.
- 0318c28: The README gains recipes for setups that are CSS or a little of your own code, not options: centring the first and last slide without `loop`, highlighting the middle slide in view (centred, by `data-focal`, or at the start, by `--deck-slide-progress`), sizing a curve (a radius in pixels to `--deck-curve-radius` in slides, and the room the arc needs in the viewport), and custom controls and a counter built on `Deck.useDeck()`. They are linked from a Recipes index and from the sections they extend.
- 8340f43: A deck with mandatory snapping that comes to rest between snap points now moves to the nearest one, and then reports its index as usual. If the user's wheel or another scroll took over a move, it moves to the nearest one in that scroll's direction, and after a move cut short, in the move's direction. With `loop`, it then jumps off a copy to its slide as usual. In Chromium, a long task on the page could leave a deck there, and the browser never snapped it back. Decks with proximity snapping stay where they rest. The deck never moves while a pointer is pressed on it, during a drag, or while a scroll is still going on.

  The deck now measures its snap points as the browser rests the slides, `scroll-padding` and `scroll-margin` included, so a move to a slide with either set ends where the browser snaps it, at once.

- ea6ce7c: A deck keeps its place when `effect` or `loop` changes after it mounts, as when a media query picks them per breakpoint. It stays at its current index, at rest on its snap point, before the browser paints the new layout, with no `onIndexChange` and nothing announced; a move in flight ends on its target, and a deck a pointer holds still goes back once it lets go. Where the new layout has fewer snap points than the index needs, the deck rests on the last one and reports it. It went to another slide: fade's snap targets, or loop's copies in WebKit, moved the snap points under the viewport. The README gains a recipe, "Change `effect`, `loop` or `autoplay` per breakpoint", linked from Effects and Autoplay.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 24534f7: The first release: a headless carousel for React 19 built on native CSS scroll snap. The browser scrolls, with its own momentum, snapping and focus scrolling; slidedeck tracks where the deck rests and asks the browser to move.

  - **Primitives**: `Deck.Root`, `Deck.Viewport`, `Deck.Slide`, `Deck.Prev`, `Deck.Next`, `Deck.Dots`, `Deck.Counter` and `Deck.AutoplayToggle`, composed as `import * as Deck from '@slidedeck/react'`. They work with no stylesheet.
  - **Layout is CSS**: slides per view, gap, alignment and their breakpoints are plain CSS, never props. Snap in pages by making only the first slide of each page a snap point; Dots and Counter then count pages.
  - **Current index**: uncontrolled with `defaultIndex`, controlled with `index` and `onIndexChange`, or imperative through `handleRef` (`scrollTo`, `next`, `prev`).
  - **Focal slide**: `data-focal`, `onFocalChange`, and `clickToFocus` to bring a clicked slide to the focal position.
  - **Loop**: `loop` runs on past the last snap point to the first with no visible jump, using `inert`, `aria-hidden` copies of the slides. `Deck.useSlide()` tells a slide's content its index and whether it is a copy, so content such as a video player can render differently in the copies.
  - **Drag**: a mouse drags the deck and a flick settles on the projected snap point; touch, pen and trackpad scroll natively. `drag={false}` turns it off.
  - **Autoplay**: `autoplay={ms}` with `Deck.AutoplayToggle`; it pauses at once when a pointer comes over the deck or the document is hidden, stops on focus or a user move, and starts stopped under reduced motion.
  - **Vertical and right-to-left**: `orientation="vertical"`, and the writing direction read from the viewport's computed `direction`, so `dir` on any ancestor applies.
  - **Progress and data attributes**: each slide's `--deck-slide-progress`, written every frame, and `data-*` state on every primitive, for CSS to read while the deck scrolls.
  - **Effects**: `fade` from `@slidedeck/react/fade` and `curve` from `@slidedeck/react/curve`, each its own entry point, so a deck ships only the effects it imports.
  - **Theme**: an optional `@slidedeck/react/theme.css` for the controls, every rule in `:where()` and every value a custom property. The autoplay toggle is filled with the accent while playing, and a dot that is not current changes under a pointer.
  - **Server rendering**: the primitives render on the server, and the deck starts at `defaultIndex` with no layout shift.
  - **Accessibility**: a carousel region with labelled slides, native buttons, a polite live region, keyboard scrolling on the viewport, focus moving into a slide bringing the deck to rest on that slide's page, even mid-move, focus within a slide or on the viewport leaving a move to arrive on the move's target snap point, and reduced-motion handling throughout.
  - **`@slidedeck/core`**: the framework-neutral engine the React package builds on.
