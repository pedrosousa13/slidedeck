/**
 * Tracks the snap point a native scroll container rests at and asks it to
 * move. The browser does the scrolling and snapping; the engine reads where
 * it settled from layout, so slide size, gap and alignment stay plain CSS.
 *
 * The slides are the viewport's children, except snap targets and copies
 * (see `slidesOf`): where an effect stacks the slides in one place, an empty
 * snap target per slide lays out along the axis in its stead, and the engine
 * measures each slide by its target.
 *
 * Loop (clone and jump, ADR-0006, as built in ADR-0009): where the viewport
 * holds a copy of every slide before the slides and another after them, each
 * marked `data-slidedeck-copy` (`before` or `after`; DOM order does not
 * matter), scrolling past the last snap point arrives at the first, and
 * back. The copies are the caller's to render, inert and `aria-hidden`. Only
 * the slides' snap points are counted: a step across the seam scrolls on
 * onto the copies, and when the viewport comes to rest on a copy's snap
 * point the engine jumps it, instantly, a set of slides back onto the
 * identical slide's snap point. Never mid-motion: a jump then would show and
 * stop momentum. But a touch or pen pressed on the copies, or a mouse drag
 * starting there, moves the deck a set onto the slides at once, where
 * nothing shows, so swipes chained faster than the deck rests never run out
 * of copies (see `shiftOffCopies`). A set of slides no longer than the
 * viewport has nothing to loop: the engine then reports one snap point, as
 * for any deck whose slides all fit, and the caller should drop the copies.
 *
 * It also writes to each slide, and each copy, for CSS to read, once a
 * frame while the viewport scrolls and whenever it settles, never through
 * `onChange` (ADR-0003):
 *
 * - `--deck-slide-progress`: the slide's progress, its signed distance from the
 *   focal position in slides. 0 at the focal position, -1 one slide before
 *   it, 2.25 two and a quarter slides after it, the way the deck runs, so a
 *   vertical or right-to-left deck reads the same. The focal position is the
 *   snap alignment point of the slide resting at the current snap point (see
 *   `DeckState.focal`), placed between the slides by where their own
 *   alignment points are: with a slide exactly at the focal position, every
 *   slide's progress is a whole number whatever the gap. Where the scroll
 *   range keeps the focal slide from reaching it, as at either end of a
 *   centred deck, progress stays fractional at rest. Measured from the
 *   slides' boxes as they are drawn (their snap targets', where there are
 *   any), so an effect should not move a slide's alignment point: scale
 *   about it (`transform-origin`), not away from it.
 * - `data-in-view`: present on each slide with at least one pixel inside the
 *   viewport's scrollport, partly in view included. It hides nothing.
