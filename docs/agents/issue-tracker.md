# Issue tracker: GitHub

<!-- factory:tracker kind=github -->

Issues and PRDs for this repo live as GitHub issues on **pedrosousa13/slidedeck**.

Use the `gh` CLI for all operations. Pass `-R pedrosousa13/slidedeck` explicitly on every
call rather than relying on the current directory's remote — a session that
runs from a worktree, a subdirectory, or another clone stays correct.

## Conventions

- **Create an issue**: `gh issue create -R pedrosousa13/slidedeck --title "..." --body
  "..."`. Title in imperative mood; use a heredoc for multi-line bodies.
- **Read an issue**: `gh issue view <n> -R pedrosousa13/slidedeck --json
  title,body,labels,milestone,state,stateReason,comments` — `comments` is a
  `--json` field, so one call returns the body and the discussion together.
- **List issues**: `gh issue list -R pedrosousa13/slidedeck --state open --limit 500 --json
  number,title,labels,milestone,createdAt`, plus `--label` / `--milestone`
  filters as needed. `--limit` defaults to 30; pass it on every listing.
- **Comment**: `gh issue comment <n> -R pedrosousa13/slidedeck --body "..."`.
- **Apply / remove labels**: `gh issue edit <n> -R pedrosousa13/slidedeck --add-label
  "..."` / `--remove-label "..."`.
- **Close**: `gh issue close <n> -R pedrosousa13/slidedeck --reason completed` (resolved)
  or `--reason "not planned"` (wontfix).

## When a skill says "publish to the issue tracker"

Create a GitHub issue on pedrosousa13/slidedeck.

## When a skill says "fetch the relevant ticket"

Run `gh issue view <n> -R pedrosousa13/slidedeck --json
title,body,labels,milestone,state,stateReason,comments`.

## Factory loop operations

GitHub's answer to each row of the tracker contract in `PROTOCOL.md`, the
Factory plugin's own protocol document — a session with the Factory
installed can find it, and one without it has no use for this section — one
bullet per row. A `/factory` Loop Session needs every one of them.

- **Reachability**: `gh auth status` resolves the `gh` CLI and confirms it
  is authenticated; `gh repo view pedrosousa13/slidedeck --json name` confirms the
  **pedrosousa13/slidedeck** repo exists and is visible to this account.
- **Queue listing**: `gh issue list -R pedrosousa13/slidedeck --state open --label
  ready-for-agent --milestone <n-or-title> --limit 500 --json
  number,title,labels,milestone,createdAt`. `--milestone` accepts either a
  milestone number or its title; drop the flag entirely for an unscoped
  run. `--limit` is not optional: `gh issue list` fetches 30 by default, so
  a Queue longer than that loses everything past the cap with no error, and
  because the order below is applied to whatever came back, the issue that
  should have been picked can simply be absent. Unstarted means the issue
  does **not** carry `in-progress` — GitHub has no started state, so the
  label stands in for one (see "Where a label is weaker than a field"
  below). Treat the result as a set of candidates to confirm, not as fact:
  the listing lags label writes, and each candidate is re-checked
  individually before it is picked.
- **Queue order**: the `P0`–`P3` labels, highest first — **`P0` (Urgent) >
  `P1` (High) > `P2` (Medium) > `P3` (Low) > no priority label** — ties
  broken by the oldest `createdAt`. Both the labels and `createdAt` come
  back on the same listing call, so ordering costs no extra call.
- **State: started**: `gh issue edit <n> -R pedrosousa13/slidedeck --add-label
  in-progress --add-assignee @me` — one call, which is what makes pickup
  atomic. GitHub issues have only `OPEN` and `CLOSED`, so `in-progress` is
  the started state.
- **State: completed / canceled**: `gh issue close <n> -R pedrosousa13/slidedeck --reason
  completed` for landed work, which reads back as `state=CLOSED`,
  `stateReason=COMPLETED`. Wontfix is two calls, because `gh issue close`
  has no label flag: `gh issue edit <n> -R pedrosousa13/slidedeck --add-label wontfix`,
  then `gh issue close <n> -R pedrosousa13/slidedeck --reason "not planned"`, which reads
  back as `state=CLOSED`, `stateReason=NOT_PLANNED`. The reason is what
  distinguishes the two — a closed issue with no reason is
  indistinguishable from either.
- **Park**: `gh issue edit <n> -R pedrosousa13/slidedeck --remove-label ready-for-agent
  --remove-label in-progress --add-label needs-info`. The issue stays
  **open**: Park returns work to an unstarted state, it does not close it.
  Removing `in-progress` is the unstarted half of the Park and is not
  optional — an issue left carrying it never re-enters the Queue even once
  it is re-labeled `ready-for-agent`.
- **Blocking**: GitHub's native **sub-issues**. Link one with `gh issue
  edit <parent> -R pedrosousa13/slidedeck --add-sub-issue <child>`; read them back with
  `gh issue view <n> -R pedrosousa13/slidedeck --json subIssues,subIssuesSummary`:

  ```json
  {"subIssues":{"nodes":[{"number":2,"state":"OPEN","title":"...",
                          "url":"..."}],
                "totalCount":1},
   "subIssuesSummary":{"completed":0,"percentCompleted":0,"total":1}}
  ```

  **Direction matters.** A sub-issue is a *child* of its parent, and the
  child **blocks** the parent: an issue is blocked while any of its
  sub-issues is still `OPEN`. Equivalently, `subIssuesSummary.completed <
  subIssuesSummary.total` means blocked. Issues filed from a plan also
  carry a `Blocked by #N` line in the body, the form `/to-tickets` writes;
  where that line is present, an open issue it names blocks this one too.
  `gh issue list` returns neither, so each candidate needs its own `gh
  issue view` — check them one at a time, in Queue order, and stop at the
  first unblocked one.
- **Milestone**: a GitHub **milestone** on the issue, not a label. Create
  one with `gh api repos/pedrosousa13/slidedeck/milestones -f title=... -f
  description=...`; list a repo's milestones with `gh api --paginate
  "repos/pedrosousa13/slidedeck/milestones?state=all&per_page=100"`, which returns them
  in GitHub's own order, stable between runs. Both halves of that query
  are load-bearing: the endpoint returns only open milestones by default
  and pages at 30, and the milestone menu is supposed to show *every*
  milestone in the Project — a stable menu shape matters more than hiding
  the closed or the empty ones. Set one with `gh issue create --milestone
  <n-or-title>` at creation, or `gh issue edit <n> -R pedrosousa13/slidedeck --milestone
  <n-or-title>` afterwards. Read a milestone's completion with `gh api
  repos/pedrosousa13/slidedeck/milestones/<n>` and its `open_issues` / `closed_issues`
  counts — GitHub reports no percentage, so compute one from the pair.
- **Milestone issue counts**: `gh issue list -R pedrosousa13/slidedeck --state all
  --milestone <n> --limit 500 --json number,labels,state,stateReason`,
  bucketed by state: **done** is `state=CLOSED` with
  `stateReason=COMPLETED`; **canceled** is `state=CLOSED` with
  `stateReason=NOT_PLANNED`; **started** is `state=OPEN` carrying
  `in-progress`; among the rest (`state=OPEN`, no `in-progress`), a
  `needs-info` label makes the issue **parked**, its absence makes it
  **unstarted**. `--limit` is not optional here either: leave it off and
  the default of 30 pins every larger milestone at exactly 30, and the
  empty-Queue report states a wrong number without any sign that it did.
  This is deliberately not a re-count of the Queue, which sees only
  `ready-for-agent`.
- **Open issues**: `gh issue list -R pedrosousa13/slidedeck --state open --milestone
  <n-or-title> --limit 500 --json
  number,title,labels,milestone,createdAt,assignees,subIssuesSummary`.
  Drop `--milestone` entirely for an unscoped call. Every open issue,
  unfiltered by label, unlike Queue listing above. Full ticket facts per
  issue: `state` derived as under **Milestone issue counts** above,
  `blockedBy` from the same sub-issue and body check as **Blocking**
  above, `claimedBy` from `assignees`.
- **Read an issue**: `gh issue view <n> -R pedrosousa13/slidedeck --json
  title,body,labels,milestone,state,stateReason,comments` — one call.
  `comments` is a valid `--json` field and returns each comment's author,
  body and timestamp, so the body and the whole discussion come back
  together. `gh issue view <n> -R pedrosousa13/slidedeck --comments` renders the same
  discussion for a human to read, but a session working from the issue
  needs only the `--json` call.
- **Comment**: `gh issue comment <n> -R pedrosousa13/slidedeck --body "..."`. Body as
  Markdown; use a heredoc so newlines stay literal.
- **Branch name**: GitHub supplies none, so it is a convention this repo
  derives: `<user>/issue-<number>-<slug>`, where `<user>` is the
  maintainer's GitHub login and `<slug>` is the issue title lowercased,
  non-alphanumerics collapsed to single hyphens, trimmed to a few words —
  e.g. `pedrosousa13/issue-42-add-the-github-adapter`. Nothing stores it,
  so every session that touches the issue must derive it the same way from
  the same title, and a session resuming an issue looks for that branch
  rather than inventing a new one.
- **State verification**: `gh issue view <n> -R pedrosousa13/slidedeck --json
  state,stateReason,labels,milestone` returns the issue's current state.
  Fetch it fresh when verifying a Pause note's claim — never compare
  against a value read earlier in the session.

## Wayfinding operations

GitHub's answer to what the `/wayfinder` skill (`~/.claude/skills/wayfinder`)
needs from a tracker. Wayfinder maps and their tickets are planning
artifacts, not work items: they carry `wayfinder:*` labels in place of the
triage axes, never `ready-for-agent` and never `in-progress`, so they can
never enter a Loop Session's Queue ("Wayfinder maps" in `PROTOCOL.md`, the
Factory plugin's own protocol document — not a file in this repo;
"Wayfinder labels" in `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`).

- **The map**: an ordinary issue on **pedrosousa13/slidedeck** labeled `wayfinder:map`.
  Find a Project's maps with `gh issue list -R pedrosousa13/slidedeck --state open
  --label wayfinder:map --limit 500 --json number,title`.
- **Labels**: `wayfinder:map`, `wayfinder:research`, `wayfinder:prototype`,
  `wayfinder:grilling`, `wayfinder:task` — repo labels on **pedrosousa13/slidedeck**,
  created lazily by the first charting session: `gh label list -R pedrosousa13/slidedeck`
  first, then `gh label create <label> -R pedrosousa13/slidedeck` only for the names that
  are missing. Never create a label you haven't first confirmed is missing.
- **Child tickets**: GitHub's native sub-issues — `gh issue edit <map> -R
  pedrosousa13/slidedeck --add-sub-issue <ticket>`, the same relation the loop's
  **Blocking** bullet reads. No conflict: under that bullet an open child
  blocks its parent, and a map with open tickets *is* a map that isn't
  finished — the map never carries `ready-for-agent`, so nothing ever
  checks it as a Queue candidate anyway.
- **Blocking between tickets**: a sub-issue has exactly one parent and the
  map holds that slot, so ticket-to-ticket edges use the body convention
  the loop already reads — a `Blocked by #N` line in the blocked ticket's
  body, added in a second pass once every ticket has a number. A ticket is
  blocked while any issue such a line names is still open.
- **Frontier**: read the map's children from `gh issue view <map> -R
  pedrosousa13/slidedeck --json subIssues`, keep the `OPEN` ones, then confirm each
  candidate with its own `gh issue view <n> -R pedrosousa13/slidedeck --json
  assignees,body,state` — unclaimed means no assignee; unblocked means no
  `Blocked by #N` line naming a still-open issue. The per-candidate view is
  the authority here for the same reason it is in Queue selection: the
  listing lags.
- **Claim**: `gh issue edit <n> -R pedrosousa13/slidedeck --add-assignee @me` — the
  assignee is the claim; an open, unassigned ticket is unclaimed.
- **Resolve**: post the resolution with `gh issue comment`, then `gh issue
  close <n> -R pedrosousa13/slidedeck --reason completed`. A ticket ruled out of scope
  closes with `--reason "not planned"` instead — resolved and ruled-out
  stay distinguishable, the same way landed and wontfix do.

## Reachability

What the Factory's Preflight checks: `gh` resolves and is authenticated,
and the **pedrosousa13/slidedeck** repo exists and is visible — `gh auth status`, then
`gh repo view pedrosousa13/slidedeck --json name`.

## If GitHub is unreachable

Say so and stop. Don't silently fall back to another tracker or local files.

## Where a label is weaker than a field

Linear-shaped trackers carry state and priority as native fields; GitHub
carries them as labels, which nothing validates. Three invariants can
therefore break. Each has a resolution rule, so two sessions over identical
state still behave the same.

- **Two priority labels on one issue.** Nothing stops `P0` and `P2` both
  being applied. Rule: **highest wins** — `P0` beats `P1` beats `P2` beats
  `P3`. Ordering stays deterministic no matter how many priority labels an
  issue carries, and no session has to stop and ask.
- **`in-progress` is enforced by nothing.** A session that dies mid-issue
  leaves the label behind; nothing removes it. Rule: `in-progress` on an
  issue with no matching branch (see **Branch name** above) is a **stale
  marker to verify, not a fact to trust** — the same posture `PROTOCOL.md`'s
  Pause note section takes toward an interrupted state. Verify against the
  branch and the Pause note; if neither backs it up, the issue was never
  really started.
- **`gh issue list` lags label writes.** Verified against a real repo:
  freshly created issues were missing from a filtered listing for tens of
  seconds, and an issue kept appearing in a `--label ready-for-agent`
  listing for about a minute after that label was removed. `gh issue view`
  on the same issue was correct immediately, every time. Rule: **the
  listing is a hint; the per-candidate `gh issue view` is the authority.**
  Queue selection already confirms each candidate individually for the
  blocker check — that same confirmation must also re-check that the
  candidate still carries `ready-for-agent`, still lacks `in-progress`, and
  is still open, and skip it otherwise. Without that re-check, a Loop
  Session that Parks an issue and immediately re-runs Queue selection
  re-picks the issue it just Parked, Parks it again, and loops forever.
